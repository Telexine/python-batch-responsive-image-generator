# Simple Batch Breakpoint generator python
This notebook script will easy generate responsive image for Frontend website, maintain aspect ratio, no stretch. Normally I have to generate it via https://www.responsivebreakpoints.com/ which quite slow for file by file. So I create some Vue component with fixed Breakpoint size [200,763,1132,1400] in other site production (not in this project) feel free to modify the code

# How to use? 
Specify the folder path that have all the image (right now is all .jpg) and breakpoint width and run script and done.

# Input 
Sample.jpg 
# Output
Sample_200.jpg, Sample_763.jpg, Sample_1132.jpg, Sample_1400.jpg
